Department Position

Department Position Rates


Pay rates differ from employee role to employee role and from department to department. A manager from one
department will not necessarily be paid the same as a manager from another department.

And so, the regular pay rate is assigned to the department's positions while the employee's position
remains generalized (eg. Department Position - HR Manager, Employee Position - Manager). The program is
aware that if an employee's position is "Manager" then they are Department "Manager" and are assigned the
pay rate of the Department "Manager".
